# About The Project

Sentiment Analysis is a useful technique for gauging public opinion about diverse subjects, allowing companies and institutions to adjust tactics, enhance goods and services, personalize promotions, heighten user satisfaction, and monitor brand image. This project helps you:

1. Discover the power of sentiment analysis and learn how to harness the vast amounts of unstructured data generated daily on social media, news articles, surveys, reviews, emails, chats, and many other sources. 
2. Gain practical skills to gather, preprocess, analyze, interpret, visualize, and communicate insights derived from natural language data. 
3. Explore different techniques used to identify emotional states, opinions, attitudes, and beliefs.
